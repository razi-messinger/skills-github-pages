Hi everybody! Today I want to talk about the things I am most passionate about! Starting with Virtual Reality. 
The future is here, Oculus was bought by Meta (formerly known as facebook) and they made the Meta Quest 3 Headset. 
Afterwards, Meta had the largest share in Virtual Reality markets in terms of headset use and in terms of apps created.
Apple even announced the Apple Vision Pro (which at the time of announcement was unprecedented considering their focus on iPhone sand Macbooks as their sales.).
